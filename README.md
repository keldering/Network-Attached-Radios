Code to control Network Attached Radios (NAR)

At the very start of this project today:

a). Exchange and deliver data (about performance etc) from interconnected (SD) Radios to facilitate user communities.

b). Creating controlling tools for use by radio users in the daily operation of their equipment.

c). Eventually aiming converging the myriads of control- and data exchange functions towards network integrated softwaretools

In the near future these global goals will certainly be refined by experience, but one has to start somewhere /:)
